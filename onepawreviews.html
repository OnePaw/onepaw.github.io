      <h2> Becky is an amazing trainer! We were having quite a few major issues with our Cali. She would
        jump up and bite on walks, snarl and nip at us if she didn’t want to obey a command, and didn’t
        really show a lot of affection. After 3 in home sessions and also boot camp at Becky’s Cali came
        back a sweet, behaved puppy. Once she realized she was not the alpha she became more
        affectionate and loving. Becky also trained us (lol) which really helped us understand our puppy.
        I would highly recommend Becky, she is a wonderful person. <STRONG>- Audrey Reale</STRONG> </h2>

      <h2>My year old border collie came from a little bit of a rough childhood. He was not socialized
        properly and because of this he is a very nervous dog around new and unknown things. He
        displays his nervousness with barking, growling, baring teeth, and lunging and would not “snap
        out of it” when I asked him any amount of simple tasks to maneuver away from those situations.
        A simple thing such as a person or dog on the other side of the street, walking in the opposite
        direction of us, would make him nervous and act out this way towards that side of the street. He
        is a sweet dog and I didn’t know what to do. I was stuck on how to help him relax and feel safe.
        That’s when I found One Paw at a Time: Dog Trainer. Becky helped Phaedo overcome these
        fears and feel comfortable. I’ve taken him through some vigorous testing because I would
        require these things from him for my normal routine.
        He had a vets appointment three days after coming home. He was completely at ease with
        crated cats and their owners walking in the room towards him and sitting across the bench. A
        dog came into the room and he did not react more than some heavy breathing and alertness,
        however he listened to his leave it command and eventually started to relax. To obtain
        something the vet directed of me we had to walk past the dog and their owner in tight space.
        The owner was aware of Phaedos situation and agreed to let him “practice” walking by. He
        didn’t react and he had proper leash tension the entire time as we walked by and I asked him to
        leave it.
        On the same day we also visited my workplace, Trent University. It was during working hours
        with a campus full of students, staff and faculty. He met several of my colleagues and walked
        around the building with absolutely no stress or nervousness.
        Becky not only helped Phaedo overcome his nervousness she also taught him to relax, not get
        too excited, not use his teeth while playing, overcome his fear of water/shower and bathing, and
        overcome his fear of grooming and toe clipping tools, walk on a leash properly, and understand
        an ecollar as a training aid.
        I’m beyond impressed with Beckys work in three weeks. She was a great person to work with
        and provided me with a demonstration and an instructional video on her page, which have been
        useful as I continue on helping Phaedo to cement his relaxed state in stone. <STRONG>- Sarah Haworth</STRONG>

      <h2>Becky is amazing! She only worked with my Carmin for 2 sessions and already there is a
        remarkable difference. Becky if flexible and affordable. Very much worth your time and money
        invested in her. I couldn&#39;t recommend her enough!! <STRONG>- Naomi Beverly</STRONG> </h2>

      <h2>Our 17 month old Great Dane is a great dog BUT, none of us could walk her due to her pulling
        on the leash extremely hard, constantly looking everywhere except where she was going, and
        barking &amp; jumping at every dog we passed (she was even barking at our security cam feeds
        when anyone walked by). Because another family member had taken their dog to Becky with a
        fantastic outcome, we thought we’d give it a try too. It was by far the best thing we’ve done sine
        getting our dog. What an amazing difference it made in every aspect. It’s the first time we’ve
        been able to enjoy taking her on walks. No pulling, absolutely no barking, pays attention to our
        commands, &amp; is an absolute pleasure to walk now. We just got a 3 month old Bengal cat &amp; her
        training is really paying off with their interactions as well. The dog is very respectful of the kitty’s
        personal space &amp; stays in her “place” command. This has allowed the kitten to get up close &amp;
        personal with the dog, which has helped the relationship develop between them quicker than it
        would have if the dog not had her training. I HIGHLY recommend the training that One Paw at a
        Time has to offer. Both my family member &amp; I have had amazing results due to Becky’s training
        &amp; she always goes about &amp; beyond. <STRONG>- Brenda Moffatt</STRONG></h2>
