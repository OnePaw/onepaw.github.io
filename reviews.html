                                    <p>Becky is an amazing trainer! We were having quite a few major issues with our Cali. She would jump up and bite on walks, snarl and nip at us if she didn’t want to obey a command, and didn’t really show a lot of affection. After 3 in home sessions and also boot camp at Becky’s Cali came back a sweet, behaved puppy. Once she realized she was not the alpha she became more affectionate and loving. Becky also trained us (lol) which really helped us understand our puppy. I would highly recommend Becky, she is a wonderful person.</p>

                                    <p>Becky is amazing! She only worked with my Carmin for 2 sessions and already there is a remarkable difference. Becky if flexible and affordable. Very much worth your time and money invested in her. I couldn't recommend her enough!!</p>

                                    <p >Our 17 month old Great Dane is a great dog BUT, none of us could walk her due to her pulling on the leash extremely hard, constantly looking everywhere except where she was going, and barking & jumping at every dog we passed (she was even barking at our security cam feeds when anyone walked by). Because another family member had taken their dog to Becky with a fantastic outcome, we thought we’d give it a try too. It was by far the best thing we’ve done sine getting our dog. What an amazing difference it made in every aspect. It’s the first time we’ve been able to enjoy taking her on walks. No pulling, absolutely no barking, pays attention to our commands, & is an absolute pleasure to walk now. We just got a 3 month old Bengal cat & her training is really paying off with their interactions as well. The dog is very respectful of the kitty’s personal space & stays in her “place” command. This has allowed the kitten to get up close & personal with the dog, which has helped the relationship develop between them quicker than it would have if the dog not had her training. I HIGHLY recommend the training that One Paw at a Time has to offer. Both my family member & I have had amazing results due to Becky’s training & she always goes about & beyond. </p>
