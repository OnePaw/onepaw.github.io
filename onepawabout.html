      <h1><strong><span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">MEET THE TRAINER</strong></span></h1><br>
      <h2> One Paw at a Time was created by Becky Pawlaczek in January of 2017. I grew up surrounded by dogs and animals but my passion for dog training began at age 13 with my little Shih-Poo Chloe. 

        Chloe was your typical out of control puppy. Nippy, jumpy, would not settle down and would chew on EVERYTHING! I grew up with a Chow Chow named Sheba who was an already trained family dog, so Chloe was a huge change for me. 
        
        Seeing how frustrated I was not being able to control a little 5 lb puppy, I took to the internet and searched my local library for any information I could on raising and training a puppy. From there I taught myself how to create a relationship with my dog and teach solid boundaries and obedience. I was just getting started. 
        
        Having Chloe decently well trained at this point, it had me curious. How many more people out there were like me. Super frustrated because they cannot create a relationship with their dog. I started doing more research and reaching out to local trainers in my area for more knowledge and training. From the age of 13 through 18 I was reading as much as I could about dog behaviour in my spare time and shadowing trainers to help expand my skills. I then felt like I was ready to share my knowledge and experience with others. 
        
        I landed an amazing job at Petsmart and became head trainer for 2 1/2 years. I absolutely loved my job at Petsmart and it was very hard for me to make the decision to leave. However I knew I could offer more. 
        
        The decision to open up my own business was not an easy one. I knew it would be hard getting started but I knew I had lots to offer in the dog community. I wanted to use my skills and knowledge to its full advantage. Reactive dogs, fearful dogs, or aggressive dogs I knew I could help. I train all breeds of any age. I also took a course to improve my skills to train dogs for service work. I can train psychiatric, PTSD and diabetic alert service dogs. 
        
        My family and friends have also played a huge role in my business. Their support has pushed me to continue to thrive for success and given many ideas on how to make One Paw a successful business. 
        
        I would also not be where I am today without the continued support from each and everyone of my clients. One Paw at a Time is now a fully established dog training business and growing! 
        
        I offer in-home private lessons, day training programs and much more! My passion is to help build a relationship between owners and their dogs to enjoy a long happy life together! 
        
        My motto is if you don’t train the dog, don’t blame them! </h2>
